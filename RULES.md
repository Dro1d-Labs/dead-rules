# Rule Sources

De-Ad uses a combination of well-established public blocklists and custom refinements.

## Upstream Sources (non-exhaustive)
- Peter Lowe’s Ad & Tracking List
- AdAway
- uBlock Origin compatible filters (subset)

## Processing
Lists are merged, normalized, and converted into Safari-compatible content blocking rules.

No rules are executed dynamically.
No network requests are made by the app.
